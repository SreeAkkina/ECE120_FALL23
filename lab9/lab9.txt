QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The program will modify register R2. The program clears the register in the AND instruction line, adds 12 to R2 in the ADD instruction line, and R2 will contain 12 when the program finishes.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Whenever programming it is very common to have compilation errors and issues with the code working as expected. In this case this step tool is very useful to see each instruction of the program to see where the error may have arised so that you could fix. Having this tool saves a lot of time since looking through each instruction trying to find the error will be tedious.
